= CoreMedia Frontend Workspace for Blueprints

This README file describes how you get started with the CoreMedia Frontend Workspace for Blueprints.

toc::[]


Developing Themes and Bricks works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

== Build with pnpm

Building directly on your workstation provides you with a immediate integration with your IDE and
is the preferred way for all frontend developers.

=== Prerequisites
* Node.js `[20.x,)`
* pnpm `[8.6.x,)`

=== Build the Themes

From the workspace root folder run the following commands, to install all dependencies and build the themes:

[source,sh]
----
pnpm install
pnpm build
----

Create a new theme and run the built-in command for developer mode. It will will automatically reload the browser if you make changes to the code.

[source,sh]
----
pnpm create-theme <name>
pnpm install
cd themes/<name>-theme
pnpm start
----

You can run tests via `pnpm test`.

For further instructions consult the _``Frontend Developer Guide``_.


Two teasers were created — each configured with a specific test image (HQ or Fuzzy).

These teasers were added to a **custom test page** for live comparison.

A **layout variant** was created to provide a tailored visual structure inside the CAE preview environment.

The layout is **accessible through the local CoreMedia test environment**, allowing responsive and rendering tests directly in preview.
